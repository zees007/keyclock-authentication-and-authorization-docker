<h1>Integrating Keycloak with Spring Boot 3: Authentication and Authorization using OAuth2.0 & OpenID Connect</h1>

In this project, I have covered Identity Providers (IDPs) such as Keycloak, explained OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, and demonstrate how to integrate these technologies with a Spring Boot application. We explored the processes of authentication and authorization, learnt how to generate access tokens, and understand how to pass these tokens to access protected resources.
